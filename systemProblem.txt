System program problem detected
Do you want to report the problem now?

first:
sudo rm /var/crash/*

After open file ==> /etc/default/apport:
gksu gedit /etc/default/apport

in the file:
# set this to 0 to disable apport, or to 1 to enable it
# you can temporarily override this with
# sudo service apport start force_start=1
enabled=1

change enabled=1 to enabled=0:
# set this to 0 to disable apport, or to 1 to enable it
# you can temporarily override this with
# sudo service apport start force_start=1
enabled=0

last step stop the still-running apport service:
 sudo stop apport
